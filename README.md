# Tata Group's Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

🚀 **Thrilled to share my experience!**

I have successfully completed Tata Group's "Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights" program using Tableau. This immersive simulation offered me a hands-on opportunity to:

✨ Work on a Big Data and create compelling data visualizations for Tata Consultancy Services using Tableau and MS Excel. <br>
📝 Prepare insightful questions for a meeting with client senior leadership. <br>
🔍 Develop visuals to assist executives in making effective, data-driven decisions. <br>

This experience allowed me to refine my 🔦 data visualization and analytical skills while gaining a deeper understanding of how data insights drive strategic business decisions. <br>
